- Safari and Chrome browser mockups (light and dark)
- Device frames: Arc, Polaroid, glass, outline, border
- 3D perspective transforms and shadow effects
- 20+ animation presets with keyframe timeline editor
- Video export in MP4, WebM, and GIF

- Tweet-to-image and code-snippet-to-image capture
- High-resolution export up to 5x scale (PNG, JPEG, WebP)
- One-click professional styling presets
- Aspect ratio presets for every social platform

## Standalone Image Tools

## Developer and API Reference

### Discovery

| Resource | URL | Format |
|----------|-----|--------|
| API Documentation | ${BASE_URL}/docs | HTML |
| Developer Portal | ${BASE_URL}/developers | HTML |
| OpenAPI Specification | ${BASE_URL}/openapi.json | OpenAPI 3.1 JSON |
| API Authentication and Rate Limits | ${BASE_URL}/docs/authentication | HTML |
| llms.txt | ${BASE_URL}/llms.txt | Markdown |
| llms-full.txt | ${BASE_URL}/llms-full.txt | Markdown |
| Sitemap | ${BASE_URL}/sitemap.xml | XML |
| robots.txt | ${BASE_URL}/robots.txt | text |

### Authentication

The public API needs no API key, token, or account. Requests are anonymous. Access is shaped by per-IP rate limits rather than credentials: \`POST /api/screenshot\` allows 20 requests per minute per IP and answers 429 with \`Retry-After\` and \`X-RateLimit-*\` headers.

### Endpoints

| Operation ID | Method | Path | Description |
|--------------|--------|------|-------------|
| captureScreenshot | POST | /api/screenshot | Capture a live URL as a base64 PNG |
| optimizeExportImage | POST | /api/export | Recompress an image as PNG, JPEG, or WebP |
| getTweet | GET | /api/tweet/{id} | Fetch a tweet payload by status ID |
| proxyTwitterImage | GET | /api/image-proxy | Same-origin proxy for Twitter media |
| getOpenApiSpec | GET | /openapi.json | This API's OpenAPI 3.1 document |
| getLlmsTxt | GET | /llms.txt | Markdown site overview |
| getLlmsFullTxt | GET | /llms-full.txt | Full Markdown reference |

### Error format

Every failing request returns JSON:

\`\`\`json
{
  "error": "URL is required",
  "code": "invalid_request",
  "message": "URL is required",
  "hint": "Send a JSON body with a url string.",
  "status": 400,
  "documentation": "${BASE_URL}/docs#errors"
}
\`\`\`

\`code\` is stable and safe to branch on. \`error\` and \`message\` carry the same human-readable text.

### Markdown content negotiation

Every page URL serves Markdown when the request prefers it:

\`\`\`
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" ${BASE_URL}/
\`\`\`

Responses set \`Content-Type: text/markdown; charset=utf-8\` and \`Vary: Accept, Accept-Encoding\`. A request that accepts neither \`text/html\` nor \`text/markdown\` is answered with 406. Unknown paths return 404 with a Markdown body listing where to look next.

### CLI and MCP

No official CLI tool and no MCP server are published yet. Agents should use the HTTP API above.
